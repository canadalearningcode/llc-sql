        #Today's Project

        Data is ever present in our lives and, as we'll see today, SQL is a powerful language that allows us to extract useful insights from large quantities of information.

        We'll be working with real data from the Canadian government, called the [Canadian Nutrient File (CNF)](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data.html)!

        This database contains nutritional information on over 5000 foods published by Health Canada.

        We'll start with SQL basics and then explore the data through some fun challenges.

        SQL is used in the databases serving many business roles, including:

        * Customer Support
        * Marketing
        * Sales
        * Finance

        **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage (**SQL**) lets us define, modify and read our data (CRUD).

        We'll focus on the part of SQL that asks questions of existing data (querying).

        A "question" to the database, formed of **clauses** (like individual sentences).

        Clauses include SQL **keywords** with **column** and **table** names to locate the data.

        1. `SELECT` starts the 1st clause, followed by the columns we want.
        2. `FROM` starts the 2nd clause, followed by the tables holding the data.
        3. `;` terminates the statement

        ```sql
        SELECT FoodDescription
        FROM FOOD_NAME;
        ```

        This returns the value of `FoodDescription` for **every row** in `FOOD_NAME`.

        # SQL Wildcards

        **Wildcards** are special characters (letters, numbers, etc.) that can replace any other character in a query. They're like cards that can take on any value in a card game.

        We'll see two wildcards today, the first is:

        * `*`, which is typically used to match any column name in a `SELECT` clause

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM table_name;
        ```

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM FOOD_NAME
        WHERE column operator value;

        1. **column** is the attribute we want to test
        1. **operator** is the type of comparison (ex.: `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)

        # Ordering Results

        Data can be ordered using the `ORDER BY` clause, following the `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses:

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM my_table
        ORDER BY my_column (ASC or DESC)
        ```

        Where:

        * **my_column** is the column to order by
        * **(ASC or DESC)**: `ASC` to sort in ascending order, or `DESC` to sort in descending order

        Let's try that out!

        2. Sort elements in ascending order on `FoodDescription`

        ```sql

        # Grouping Results

        The `GROUP BY` clause combines rows and calculates total values for these groups.

        ```sql
        GROUP BY column_name
        ```

        Combines rows with identical values in `column_name`, or "throws them in the same bucket".
